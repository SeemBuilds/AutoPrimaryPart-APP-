# Steps
1. Select any vehicle(model).
2. In the APP UI panel, enable `Selection Detector` and enable the `vehicleEnabled` option.
3. Click on the `Run` button in APP.

# How it works
- Runs the `ADD` operation: Creates a new Part whose size and position is the same as the BoundingBox(creates a BoundingBox replica).

# Common mistakes
1. Model has no BaseParts; No BoundingBox

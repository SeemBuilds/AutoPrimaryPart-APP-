How to use the operation `HANDLE`:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79985940-cdd2-4ed1-be10-b7d58d7b1f92

# Steps
1. Select the `HANDLE` mode in the APP UI. 
2. Select any model or tool.
3. Click on the `Run` button in APP.

# How it works
- Searches for "handle" in all BasePart names of your model/tool that are converted to lower case internally, i.e. in APP scripts.
- So even if your BasePart name contains "handle" with a bunch of other letters or "handle" is written with upper and lower case letters., the `HANDLE` mode sets it as the Primary Part. Example: jnnsd`handle`nnkf or nsnfH`hAnDle`nnskjd

# Common mistakes
1. *None*

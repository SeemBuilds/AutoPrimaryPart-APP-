# Tutorial Setups
In the tutorial, different setups were used. 

**For `SET`, `ADD`, `BIGGEST`, `SMALLEST`, `HIGHEST`, `LOWEST`, `RANDOM` this setup was used to present the modes in the simplest and most understandable way:**

A model, named `ExampleModel`, made out of 3 parts:
- The top part named "*Top*"
- The middle part named "*Mid*"
- The bottom part named "*Bottom*"

The model has highlighting for better visualization.

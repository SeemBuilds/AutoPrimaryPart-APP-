## Usage
To use APP, you must have installed it!
After that, click on the Plugin Tab, select APP and click the UI button.

In the panel, close every window. This will make it easier to see everything at a glance.

   - **Select Mode Window**
     
        - In this window, you can select a variety of modes, each one having a unique ability to set your PrimaryPart.
        - Just click near the circle to select or change modes:

        - Each Mode's features are listed [here](#features)
          
   - **SelectionDetector**
        - SelectionDetector automatically detects your selection after looking for specific parts and names.
        - *Example:* You have selected a building that contains parts with ‚ÄúWall‚Äù in their names: Your Selection is likely a building(just a rough example)!
        - By opening the `Customize Detection` panel in `Selection Detector`, you can customize what should be detected or not. This may be important if your model includes names or parts, that are also relevant for another Detection.
        -  *Example:* If you have a character selected, but for some reason it includes parts with "Wall" found in their names, SelectionDetector could specify your Selection as a house and not as character!

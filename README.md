   - **Select Mode Window**

        - Each Mode's features are listed [here](#features)
          
   - **SelectionDetector**
        - SelectionDetector automatically detects your selection after looking for specific parts and names.
        - *Example:* You have selected a building that contains parts with ‚ÄúWall‚Äù in their names: Your Selection is likely a building(just a rough example)!
        - By opening the `Customize Detection` panel in `Selection Detector`, you can customize what should be detected or not. This may be important if your model includes names or parts, that are also relevant for another Detection.
        -  *Example:* If you have a character selected, but for some reason it contains parts with ‚ÄòWall‚Äô in their names, SelectionDetector might incorrectly identify it as a house.
        -  ***To enable SelectionDetector, simply click on the checkbox:***

 ## Versioning
Sometimes APP updates can result in certain modes and options being changed. Versioning is used to retain the desired options and modes after version requests. In APP there is a Versioning panel, with a Versioning TextBox. There you can enter your desired version. This version will now always be used for you, unless you change it.  Please note that if you enter an incorrect or empty version, the version will be loaded to the latest version.

How to revert to any version:
1. in this Github repo, navigate to releases.
There you will find every version of APP.
2. click on your desired version.
You will see a JSON code.
3. copy the value of ‚Äúversion‚Äù.
4. in the APP plugin in Roblox studio, under Versioning, paste the copied value into the TextBox.
5. done!
